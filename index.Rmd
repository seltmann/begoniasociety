***Dr. Katja Seltmann*** is the Katherine Esau Director of the [Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration](https://www.ccber.ucsb.edu), University of California, Santa Barbara. At CCBER I direct three main research and programmatic areas â€” collections management, education, and restoration. The integration of these activities supports faculty, staff, and student research interests by providing field, collection and lab-based resources. CCBER houses over 500,000 regionally focused specimens of insects, terrestrial plants, algae, and vertebrates, as well as many smaller collections. The Center satisfies the University's obligation to provide stewardship of campus lands, rich in biodiversity. My research program at the Cheadle Center is in the field of biodiversity informatics, or data science research of digitized natural history collection records, entomology (especially Hymenoptera) and media arts.
