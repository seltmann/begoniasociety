***Dr. Katja Seltmann*** is the Katherine Esau Director of the [Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration](https://www.ccber.ucsb.edu), University of California, Santa Barbara. At CCBER I direct three main research and programmatic areas: natural history collections, ecological restoration and environmental education.

My own research is in the field of biodiversity informatics, or data science research of digitized natural history collections, insect biodiversity, and expanding music and art practice in a scientific context.
