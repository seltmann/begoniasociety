I am the Katherine Esau Director of the [Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration](https://www.ccber.ucsb.edu), University of California, Santa Barbara. At the Cheadle Center, I direct three main programmatic areas â€” collections management, education, and ecological restoration. My arts and entomology research program combine biodiversity data science research of digitized natural history collection specimens, entomology, and media arts. I publish research about insect biodiversity, data management, and insect responses to environmental changes or conditions. I regularly create artworks under the name Irene Moon that bring the aesthetics of the entomology laboratory in front of alternative audiences in the form of absurd, factual presentations about insects, musical recordings, radio, and performances connecting science and fable.
